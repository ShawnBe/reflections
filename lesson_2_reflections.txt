What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new starting point is created to allow you to track changes to the different files in the folder.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to combine changes to multiple files as one logical commit rather than having to comit each change separately
