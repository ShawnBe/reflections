diff showed the bugs because the code was working before so 
therefore something was changed to stop it from working, by
showing the places in the code where changes were made it helps
to narrow the area that needs to be searched to show where the 
problem lies.

Having easy access to the history of a file can show what changes 
were made and allow you to undo new changes that may not work as 
intended. 

Manual commit pros
Choose a logical point to save (such as a new feature)
Auto saving may save while in the middle of coding and code
may not compile.

Cons
Programmer may forget to save and loose changes.

if there is an error it would be simple to revert to the last set of code that works.

I want to try using Git to manage code changes. Undo changes and work with other developers.
